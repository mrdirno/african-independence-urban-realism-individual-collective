### Story Entry Points

- Write a chapter from the perspective of the bus conductor, detailing his 'theology' of the city and the passengers he sees as souls in transit.
- Create a short story about the two women arguing under the umbrella. What debt or betrayal are they settling, and what history do they share?

### Technical Entry Points

- Build an interactive map of Kola's journey from Surulere to Obalende, annotating locations with sensory details (smells, sounds, textures) from the text.
- Create a 'Lagos Catechism' generator that produces dialogue based on the novel's themes: a web tool that randomizes questions like 'You dey go where?' and 'You get business?' with context-appropriate responses.
